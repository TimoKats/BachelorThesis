### The content of this page

- An anonymized version of the data used for my thesis. Due to the legislation around intellectual property it's not allowed to publish full articles. Therefore the data set only shows the title, the news source and the sponsor (if any).
- The lexicon that was derived from this research. Contains 5000 terms with catagory and score.
- Some source code that was used. If you download it the machine learning won't work since it requires the full/non-anonymized data set.
- Game.py, which is a small quiz game that tests whether you can differentiate articles and advertorials!
